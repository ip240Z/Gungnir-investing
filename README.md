# Gungnir Investments React Application

This React.js application makes use of the Alpha Vantage API's historical trade data and news endpoints. 

The primary goal is to provide a user with a daily candlestick chart dating to the past 6 months.
Especially for newer investors, a longer, less minute-by-minute strategy is typically a safer way of entering the equities markets. 

The user begins by searching a ticker inside the main body of the application. Upon submitting their searched ticker, 
a candlestick chart is rendered inside main container. After searching a ticker, the user is then able to click the "News"
button to render a list of relevant news articles about that ticker. The user can switch between these two views without delay.

This tool's function is to bring the basic ideas of equities market investing to those with little to no experience.
